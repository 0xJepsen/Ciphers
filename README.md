# Ciphers
A compolation of cipher algorithms in different languages

## Ceasars Cipher (simple)

This is a classic cipher called a Caesar Cipher. The cesaar cipher.
You take your message, something like "hello" and then you shift all 
of the letters by a certain offset. For example, chose an offset of 3 
and a message of "hello". Code the message by shifting each letter 3 
places to the left (with respect to the alphabet). So "h" becomes "e",
"e" becomes, "b", "l" becomes "i", and "o" becomes "l". Then the coded message is "ebiil"
